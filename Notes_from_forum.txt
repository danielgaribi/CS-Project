Asm:
[] - Circle - instruction to check cirle.asm (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=28522#p37693, https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=44629)
[] - ***importent*** Binum & mulmat - must set initial memory using .word before running the progrem (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=35211) 
[v] - disk - sector 1 and 0 are equel at the end of the run (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=31999)

Assembler:
[V] - lower case for opcodes and registers names (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=34115)
[] - ***importent*** printing next line using '/r' and not '/n' (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=37484)

Simulator:
[v] - diskin.txt - instruction for printing (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=30661)
[V] - timer.txt and diskin.txt as input - must set those file for simulator, even if empty (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=31712)
[V] - input file can contain Hex with lower and upper letters, even in the same line (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=27957)
[v] - Disk - instruction to set the memory as a cyclic memory (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=33373)
[v] - interrupt flow for 2 interrupts together (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=36815, https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=40772, https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=44888)
[v] long explanation about interrupts (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=44117)
[] - shifter with negative number (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=36996)
[V] - ***importent*** printing next line using '/r' and not '/n' (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=37484)
[v] - no relations between timer and disk in simulator unless the assembler coded that way (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=42071)
[V] - ***importent*** simulator must not crush for ileagal input, no valid opcode for example. should add defult for switch and exit cleanly? (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=42897)
[V] - read regs as signed numbers for opcode such as mac, slt.. (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=43480)
[V] - we can print lower and upper case letter, and should be able to read them both (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=44652)
[v] - ***importent*** timer - the time printed to the file is not the one from the register clk but another counter, use 64 bit (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=43496)
[v] - timer getting to max value (https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=46451)

Subbmission:
